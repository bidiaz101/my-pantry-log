# My Pantry Log - Preventing Food Waste

According to the U.S. Deparment of Agriculture, an estimated 30-40 percent of the
entire US food supply is wasted. My Pantry Log is intended to reduce that figure.

Users can log expiration dates of foods at risk of spoilage, focusing
on meats and produce. The app will have foods that the user can put in their 
digital pantry/refrigerator and note the quantity. 

The app will count down the days until the food spoils based on the typical amount of time that food takes to spoil. 
Users can edit this timer before or after they save it. Each food item has a table displaying how long food is good under different conditions (room-temp., refrigerated, frozen, etc.). Users can edit based on that table. 
If the timer is inaccurate, the food will come with signs of spoilage to look for. If a user if 
unsure how to use a food that is about to spoil they will be able to click on a link 
that will take them to a page full of recipes that include that ingredient. The user than then delete food 
from their pantry if they have eaten it or if, perish the thought, it spoils... ðŸ˜“

A score will be kept and as a user eats food, the app will let them know how much money they have saved. 
The price of their food items may vary as well so, if the user wishes, they can update 
the price of their items as well. This score is intended to motivated users to remember to use food they buy.

My Pantry Log uses a React frontend, Ruby on Rails for the backend, and Postgresql 
for creating the relational database.
