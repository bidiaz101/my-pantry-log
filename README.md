My Pantry Log - Preventing Food Waste

According to the U.S. Deparment of Agriculture an estimated 30-40 percent of the
entire US food supply is wasted. My Pantry Log is intended to reduce that figure.

Users will be able to log expiration dates of foods at risk of spoilage, focusing
on meats and produce. The app will have foods that the user can put in their 
digital pantry/refrigerator and note the quantity. The app will count down the days 
until the food spoils based on the typical amount of time that food takes to spoil. 
This time can vary, so users will be able to change the timer on each individual food 
item. There will be reminders to use the food before it spoils and, if the timer is 
inaccurate, the food will come with signs of spoilage to look for. If a user if 
unsure how to use a food that is about to spoil they will be able to click on a link 
that will take them to a page full of recipes that include that ingredient. There 
will also be a shopping list feature that gives a notification if an ingredient being 
bought already exists in the user's digital pantry. The user than then delete food 
from their pantry if they have eaten it or if, perish the thought, it spoils... ðŸ˜“

A score will be kept and as a user eats food, the app will let them know how many 
pounds of food waste they have prevented and how much money they have saved. The 
price of their food items may vary as well so, if the user wishes, they can update 
the price of their items as well.

My Pantry Log uses a React frontend, Ruby on Rails for the backend, and Postgresql 
for creating the relational database.
